# React News App

This project is a news app using React and TypeScript. It shows the latest world news. You have the option of searching for articles with a keyword. I used Fireabase authentication to register and log in the users. You can also like selected articles and come back to them on UserPage, they will save in Firebase Cloud Firestore.
